# This is first try and seems work.
word = input('Please write down a word: ')

# There is a problem. This fails when a one-letter-word given.

#Let's try different way:

word = input('Please write down a word: ')
def front_back(word):
    word_list = list(word)
    keep_in_mind = word_list[0], word_list[-1]
    word_list[0] = keep_in_mind[1]
    word_list[-1] = keep_in_mind[0]
    return (''.join(word_list))
    
print(front_back(word))

#Yes! it works :-)
